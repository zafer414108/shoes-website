# A simple shoe web page

# Technologies used
This example homepage is designed using HTML and CSS.

It will also be striking to have a featured product on the homepage.

In the next section, the addition of the images of a newly released product by showing them from the bottom and top from the right to the left will increase the interest on the page.

It will be nice to have customer reviews and introduction sections in the following sections, and finally a classic footer.

It can be used as a simple project.
